Next Release: + 0.0.0.1
 - fixed a bug in normalize that was producing images with NaN pixel values

unm-hip-0.1.1.4
 - Re-export Data.Complex in Data.Image.Complex
 - Added instance RealFloat a => Ord (C.Complex a) where
 - fixed a bug in Normalize that was producing images with NaN pixel values
 - Removed (~) class of functions to reduce confusion. (Break backwards compatability)

unm-hip-0.0.0.3
 - Exported the Data.Image.Arithmetic module

unm-hip-0.0.0.2
 - Adjusted the label function to reduce to the lowest label values. This results in "better" output for areas, boundingBoxes, and centersOfMass
 - Added the Arithmetic module that provides support for arithmetic operations on images using scalar values.

unm-hip-0.0.0.1
 - Added an error if fft or ifft are used with a non power of 2 image
 - Fixed error in equivalence labeling in label
 - Made consistent if and only if through out documentation
 - Fixed typo in Complex.hs haddock under fft.

unm-hip-0.0.0.0
Initial release containing functionality for Boxed Images
